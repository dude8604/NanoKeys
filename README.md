# NanoKeys
Connect a BLE Nano to mobile devices by providing a HID keyboard interface

Turn a BLE Nano into a wireless keyboard.

This library makes sending wireless keystrokes to bluetooth low energy devices easy, thanks to a standard Print interface (like that used by Serial).
See the [NanoKeys project site](http://flyingcarsandstuff.com/projects/NanoKeys/) for docs, caveats, installation directives and examples.

I added control of key up and key dowm events to give finer control over the BLE keyboard.

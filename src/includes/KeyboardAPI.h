 *
 * The Keyboard is just a standard Arduino Print interface
 * implementation, meaning that everything supported by Print
 * (like printing strings and numbers in user-selected bases)
 * will just work, with one caveat:
 *
 *  * only values between [0, 127] -- i.e. good ol ascii -- are actually
 *    mapped by the underlying service.
 *
 * For the most part, use the Keyboard instance like you would use
 * Serial, for writing.
